# A Study of TREND of Electronic PAYMENT In India
              In this study, I explored transaction patterns across private and public sector banks using seasonal indexing and polynomial regression. Our analysis identified key transaction peaks in March, October, and December, particularly for NEFT, RTGS, and mobile banking.
# Key Findings:
1 Seasonal patterns highlight the impact of festivals & e-commerce sales on digital payments.
2 High RÂ² values in predictive models ensure strong trend accuracy.
3 Insights help financial institutions align strategies with customer behavior.
